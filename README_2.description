This is deeper description of my transfer learning model, with more analyze and plot graphs
# First I load my data like previous, I save url, then get file with flower photos, save it in directory and unzip 
# Then I import pathlib and change my data using "pathlib.Path", now its ready for operations
# Next I sort my data, I create one dict for flower photos and change all images in one category into list
