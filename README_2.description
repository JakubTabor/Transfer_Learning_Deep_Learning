This is deeper description of my transfer learning model, with more analyze and plot graphs
# First I load my data like previous, I save url, then get file with flower photos, save it in directory and unzip 
# Then I import pathlib and change my data using "pathlib.Path", now its ready for operations
# Next I sort my data, I create one dictionary for flower photos and change all images in one category into list 
# Now I create dictionary for labels of my flowers types, so I assign number for every type
# Then I call my object to check if everything works good and now its time to resize my images
# Now I create function which task is to get acces to images in my dict and then resize every image and append ready images and their labels into lists
