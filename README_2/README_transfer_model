Now I gonna describe i details how function transfer model
# First i load pretrained model and save it as "feature_extractor_model"
# Then i use "hub.KerasLayer" and put inside first my model, then the shape and disable the training, so I froze it during the training
# I save it as "pretrained_model_without_top_layer" and I gonna use it in keras model  
# Now I gonna create keras model to train it on my flowers dataset, with help of pretrained model 
# So first i stop number of classes as variable, then I create keras model and put as a layer "pretrained_model_without_top_layer"
# Then I put also Dense layer with number of classes and look at summary of this model
