TRANSFER LEARNING (DEEP LEARNING) FOR CLASSIFICATION

![](https://github.com/JakubTabor/Transfer_Learning_Deep_Learning/blob/main/images/image.png)

Transfer Learning is tehnic that include (storing knowledge gained during the problem solvation) and apply it to a different but similar problem

In this repository I gonna use pre-trained model ("https://tfhub.dev/google/tf2-preview/mobilenet_v2/feature_vector/4")
And I gonna use it to do image Classification

If you want extended model for Classification also it is here (google/tf2-preview/mobilenet_v2/classification/4)
