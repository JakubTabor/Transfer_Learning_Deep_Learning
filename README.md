TRANSFER LEARNING (DEEP LEARNING) FOR CLASSIFICATION

![](https://github.com/JakubTabor/Transfer_Learning_Deep_Learning/blob/main/images/image.png)

Transfer Learning is tehnic that include (storing knowledge gained during the problem solvation) and apply it to a different but similar problem

In this repository I gonna use pre-trained model ("https://tfhub.dev/google/tf2-preview/mobilenet_v2/feature_vector/4")
And use it to do flower image Classification
We are gonna notice the change in accuracy and then I gonna show in visual way (on graphs) whats the difference between new build model 
And model with deep previous knowledge, how they perform differently on the same problem

If you want extended model for Classification also it is here (google/tf2-preview/mobilenet_v2/classification/4)
