# Transfer_Learning_Deep_Learning
I gonna use pretrained model to use it on my data
# First I gonna store size of image shape in variable, then I gonna load pretrained model and store it as "classifier"
# I change "input_shape" adding additional (3,)) to my stored variable (224, 224), so now it look like this (224, 224, 3)
# Now I gonna show image of "goldfish" using "Image.open" and resize it into my new "IMAGE_SHAPE" it is good plotted
